This project is a web-based photo editor application that allows users to upload an image and apply various styling properties to it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The photo editor provides an intuitive interface for users to customize their images with features such as border color, border size, border style, border radius, opacity, grayscale, rotation, and size scaling. Users can apply these styles in real-time and then save the edited image with all applied properties intact.
