Hello, it's Jad Mattar. This is a description file of the project.

In this project, I built a photo editor webpage, in which the user can upload an image 
and change its properties.
The photo editor provides an intuitive interface for users to customize their images with features such as:
1- Border
2- Border-radius
3- Opacity
4- Grey-scale
5- Rotation
6- size

We used in this project HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
HTML is for the content, CSS is for styling and JavaScript is for interactivity and setting the properties of styling of image.
We retrived values of the properties from the user and used the function setAttributes in javascript in order to style the image
uploaded by the user as wanted. Adding conditions to the inputs targets the input validation as well.

This project demonstrates the powerful capabilities of web technologies to create interactive and user-friendly applications.
This project showcases my ability to integrate and utilize core web technologies to build functional and interactive user interfaces. 
It demonstrates my skills in front-end development, problem-solving, and attention to detail, making it a valuable project.
